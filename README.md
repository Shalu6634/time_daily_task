# Asynchronous Programming
1) What is Asynchronous Programming?

=>
 Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks or operationto run independently nd concurrently, without waiting for each other to complete before moving on to the next task. In traditional synchronous programming,tasks are executed one after another ,and the program waits for each task to finish before proceeding to the next one.

2) What is Future Class ?

=>
The Future class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation. This result will eventually appear in the Future after the processing is complete. Let's see how to write methods that create and return a Future instance.
